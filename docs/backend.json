    "reasoning": "This Firestore data structure is designed to support the WATTch application, focusing on electricity monitoring with real-time data display. The structure leverages path-based ownership for user data and nested resources to ensure secure and scalable data management. Google Sign-In integration is accommodated through the `googleId` field within the `User` entity. Authorization independence is achieved by using path-based ownership (`/users/{userId}`) which obviates the need for complex `get()` calls in security rules. The design supports the required QAPs through structural segregation; each collection is homogeneous, simplifying security rules, and list operations are secured via path-based ownership."
